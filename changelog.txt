/* place any large or controversial changes here*/

11/30:	removed double/multi buffer
	  - it will be more clear to load all of a site's code and parse from there.
	replaced string_queue w/ utils/string_linked_list

12/05:	added typedef back to urlinfo
	  - code I just merged depended upon it
	  - We can change it back if that would be better, though.

12-06:	added utils/parser.[ch]
	crawler_control currently just grabs the whole <a> tag
	needs to be updated to pull just the link
